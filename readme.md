## What's this?

A minimal demo dealing with authentication (Oxygen login) and loading a facility from Autodesk Tandem in vanilla js using the _Tandem SDK_ (@adsk/lmv-double-trouble). Snowpack is used as a development server (which is required for the login redirects).

## Prerequirements

Make sure you have an account and access to at least one facility at https://tandem-stg.autodesk.com. 

## Setup

After cloning this repo, run `npm install`.


## Start App

To start the development server, run `npm start`. It's opening the browser for you at http://localhost:8080 which should take you to the login first and then back to your app.
